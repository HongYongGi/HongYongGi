### :mortar_board: Education

* Gachon University, Incheon, Korea - Master of Biomedical Engineering
* Gachon University, Incheon, Korea - Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering





### Interest
I am currently interested in Artificial General Intelligence, Artificial intelligence in medical Imaging(PET, CT, MRI, X-ray, etc.), Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, RestAPI Dev.

I have studied medical imaging as a major from bachelor's to master's degree. During my master's period, I studied PET-CT as my major. I have done research on Cephalogram landmark detection, Identification of Breathing Patterns through EEG Signal Analysis Using Machine Learning, Malocclusion Classification using Deep Learning, Development of Artificial Intelligence-Based Evolutionary Image Reconfiguration Technology for Improving Spatial Resolution of Nuclear Medical Imaging Systems.

Misc.
I've been playing the piano since I was 7 and can play other instruments too. I am still active as a flute part in the orchestra. He also regularly holds piano concerts.

I also enjoy playing double piano pieces with others. Let me know if you would like to play music with me.
